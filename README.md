Yo!

Some details that don't fit neatly on a resume because I'm a self-taught meanderer:

- 20+ years of on-and-off coding experience. I started with customizing the HTML of forums back in 2003, then moved onto custom profiles on MySpace and Gaia Online. Countless tutorials and courses ranging from college courses on Web Development to Udemy courses on Python and some FCC and Odin Project. My interest is primarily in game development, but I'm not rigid. I just enjoy learning, and enjoy programming way more than delivering beer kegs.



So, 20 years of learning by playing, and in 2025 decided to just dive all the way in.



Languages I've Built Projects With:
- GDScript (Godot game engine language, often likened to Python syntax)
- C# (Mostly via building projects in Unity)
- JavaScript
